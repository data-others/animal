The **PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE)** is a global initiative dedicated to accelerating nonhuman primate (NHP) neuroimaging research through open data sharing and collaboration. Much like the Human Connectome Project revolutionized human neuroimaging, PRIME-DE aims to break barriers and set new standards for data accessibility and reproducibility in the NHP research community.

Launched in 2018, PRIME-DE provides an openly shared repository of NHP MRI data, fostering a culture of cooperation among researchers worldwide. This effort was further strengthened by the **Global Collaboration Workshop (GCW)** in 2019, where the community outlined key priorities, including:



- **Standardizing data collection** to enhance reproducibility and maximize the value of shared datasets.

- **Improving imaging methodologies** for both anesthetized and awake NHP studies.

- **Ensuring ethical transparency** and promoting responsible animal welfare policies.

- **Developing open-source analytic tools** and data processing pipelines tailored for NHP neuroimaging.



Through these collective efforts, PRIME-DE is paving the way for large-scale, multimodal research that bridges the gap between human and NHP neuroscience. By fostering global collaboration, PRIME-DE seeks to advance our understanding of brain function and facilitate breakthroughs in translational medicine.
