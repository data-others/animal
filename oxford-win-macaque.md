### **Scan Procedures and Parameters**



_Protocol information:_ Diffusion-weighted imaging was done on a 7T superconductive magnet driven by an Agilent DirectDrive console (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using 72mm ID quadrature birdcage RF coil (Rapid Biomedical GmbH, Rimpar, Germany). 2D diffusion-weighted images were acquired by a spin-echo single line readout protocol (DW-SEMS, TE/TR: 25 ms/10 s; matrix size: 128 × 128; resolution: 0.6 x 0.6 mm; number of slices: 128; slice thickness: 0.6 mm). Each DTI data set consisted of 16 non-diffusion-weighted (b = 0 s/mm2) and 128 diffusion-weighted (b = 4000 s/mm2) volumes with diffusion directions homogeneously distributed over the sphere.



_Procedure:_ The brains were soaked in PBS before scanning and placed in fomblin or fluorinert during the scan. Diffusion-weighted images were processed using FMRIB's Diffusion Toolbox.
